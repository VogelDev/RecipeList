# Recipe List
## Purpose
+ To explore single page applications
+ To work with getting and setting data via an api
 + I don't consider the php that currently exists as an api, but I'm using it like one
+ Somewhere to save recipes because I lose or ruin paper copies

## Process
<code>npm install</code>   
<code>grunt</code>  
These commands will install the necessary packages and run the grunt task runner in dev mode by default.  
You can run <code>grunt prod</code> to remove source maps and uglify the bundle.

## Packages of note

+  [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)  
+  [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com)  
+  [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)  
+  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)  
+  [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but I recently started thinking about this project again.  
I'll update as I can.
